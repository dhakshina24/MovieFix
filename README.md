# üìΩÔ∏è MovieFix: A smart Movie Recommendation System
MovieFix is a scalable and end-to-end movie recommendation system that leverages semantic embeddings to deliver personalized movie suggestions. It extracts and processes movie data from the TMDB API, generates embeddings using a Sentence Transformer, and uses FAISS for fast similarity search. The system features an interactive Streamlit web app, allowing users to discover movies based on storyline and semantic similarity rather than generic ratings.


## Tech Stack 
- Python: pandas, NumPy, requests (for REST API)
- HuggingFace: Sentence Transformer
- FAISS: Vector similarity search
- Streamlit: Interactive frontend UI


## Data Source
This project uses movie metadata and content from the [TMDB (The Movie Database) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) as its primary data source. 


## Key Features 
- Scalable Vector Search using Pinecone
- Lightweight system with quantized Llama - 2 model 
- End-to-End Pipeline
- Evaluation Pipeline for measuring response quality and chunk relevance.
- Modular design 


## Key Features
- Batch Extraction: Fetches movie data from TMDB API.
- Seamless Loading: Stores raw data efficiently in CSV format.
- Data Cleaning: Transforms and prepares data for recommendations.
- Semantic Embeddings: Captures movie meaning with Sentence Transformers.
- Fast Vector Search: Finds similar movies instantly using FAISS.
- Interactive App: Real-time, storyline-based recommendations via Streamlit.
